This website is meant to share a bit about myself and give you some insight to my life. While I am not the most interesting person, I have nothing else I could make a website on.
Some of it's interesting features include:

<ul>
<li>Functioning links within the navigation bar and footer</li>
<li>Links on the footer change to a lighter green when being hovered over</li>
<li>Links on the navigation bar change to a darker green when being hovered over</li>

<li>Functioning carousel showcasing pictures of me and my bestfriends</li>
<li>Simple and clean color palette</li>
<li>Email and fake phone number for contacting me</li>
